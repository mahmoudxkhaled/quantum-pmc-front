                            fully integrated Project Controls systems which can easily support each other for on-time
                            and
                            on-budget achievement of targets and goals.</li>
                        <li>Our team have managed or supported in the development of Integrated Project Controls systems

                            with other functions such as Planning, Progress Monitoring, or Change Management. Cost
                            systems development can vary from few changes to the existing Cost Breakdown Structure
                            (CBS) and Cost Monitoring System, or up to the full restructuring of cost procedures and
                            systems.</li>
                        <li>Develop an automated mapping system between the Planning’s Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
                            and the Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS) for the integration of various Progress data to
                            achieve verifiable reporting and invoicing functions.</li>
                        <li>Develop and/or operate a documents management system which can support the timely planning
                            and management of Project’s documentation. Such service can be established either by

                            available in the market, or develop an in-house system for the maximum achievement of the
                            requirements of the project and/or the company’s team.</li>

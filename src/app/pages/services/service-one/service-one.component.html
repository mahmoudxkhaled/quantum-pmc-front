                        <li>One of the major challenges that face construction companies/projects is the development of
                            fully integrated project controls systems that can easily support each other for on-time
                            and
                            on-budget achievement of targets and goals.</li>
                        <li>Our team has managed or supported in the development of integrated project controls systems
                            for
                            several top-level construction companies, and thus we can offer our clients the support to:
                        </li>
                        <li>Develop or restructure an existing cost management system in order to integrate its data
                            with other functions such as planning, progress monitoring, or change management. Cost
                            systems development can vary from few changes to the existing cost breakdown structure
                            (CBS) and cost monitoring system, or up to the full restructuring of cost procedures and
                            systems.</li>
                        <li>Develop an automated mapping system between the planning's work breakdown structure (WBS)
                            and the cost breakdown structure (CBS) for the integration of various progress data to
                            achieve verifiable reporting and invoicing functions.</li>
                        <li>Develop and/or operate a documents management system that can support the timely planning
                            and management of project documentation. Such service can be established either by
                            utilizing existing electronic document management system (EDMS), adopting another EDMS
                            available in the market, or developing an in-house system for the maximum achievement of the
                            requirements of the project and/or the company's team.</li>
